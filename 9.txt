With respect to your comment I like to counter that I am feeling to comply with "the API": First: parallel() is a property of the stream. It tells that this stream can be processed in a non-serial manner, splitted into subtask. It does not enforce that tasks are distributed to other threads. In fact: just ran my code setting parallelism to 1 and everything works fine, even with that Semaphore. Second: It is documented that streams use a ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinPool and Semaphore belong to the same package: java.util.concurrent! So I believe everybody would assume they should be compatible
