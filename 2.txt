Jimmy Wales had categorically denied community concerns that WMF was developing a search engine via the Knowledge Engine, calling the suggestion “a lie”.
Andreas Kolbe, who pieced together the Knowledge Engine story for a Wikipedia Signpost article this week, says the details of the grant have come as a surprise.
“Its gung-ho 'We're building a search engine!' content is a bit of a bombshell for the volunteer community," said Kolbe. "They were led to believe it was just about getting a central search function to find stuff spread out across the various Wikimedia sites, with OpenStreetMap thrown in perhaps… Volunteers feel WMF management has purposely kept them out of the loop.”
At least two of the six "conceptual directions for discovery", aka redesigns of the Wikipedia front page, sure look like Google-style search engines to us
