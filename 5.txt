Your assumption is erroneous. Once you turn over the parallelism to the API you relinquish your ability to control the inner workings of that parallel mechanism. Briefly, Streams is lazy. It builds the stream then it executes the terminal operation. You can control the parallelism with the system property but you cannot control what happens therein. Iâ€™m sure someone will find a good use for Semaphores sometime within a parallel stream, but not here.
