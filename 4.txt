Thank you. I know that this is the reason. I know that they use a shared pool. However, I find the behavior unexpected. If the inner loop is executed there is at least one thread running (namely that, starting the execution of the inner loop). If all others are blocked, why is the inner loop forking at all? He could just run single threaded. Also note that I have only blocked 5 out of 10
