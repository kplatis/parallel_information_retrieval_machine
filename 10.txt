First: I started reading the webpage you have linked. Thank you for that. It is valueable! Second: This post and the answers and comments were too much focused on the use of the Semaphore. I would like to view that Semaphore now just as a tool, to bring up the unexpected interlocking which occurs by nesting (and which is a problem introduced by the specific common FJP). To get away from that Semaphore discussion I created that other test case, see stackoverflow.com
